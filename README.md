# Emotion_Detector_and_Image_Analysis

## Overview
This project is an Emotion Detection and Image Analysis system that utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze human emotions based on body language and facial expressions. The model leverages **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **scikit-learn** to process images and detect emotional cues.

## Features
- 🎭 Real-time Emotion Detection using **MediaPipe**
- 📸 Facial Expression and Body Language Analysis
- 🤖 Uses Machine Learning for classification
- 📂 Works with image and video input

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
### Running the Emotion Detector
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detector.git
   cd emotion-detector
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the provided `.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.
4. Upload an image or video for analysis.
5. View the detected emotions in real time.
